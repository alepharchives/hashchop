    detailed = [[
Hashchop uses a rolling hash to deterministically break streams of raw
data into bounded-size chunks. If two byte streams have mostly identical
content, with only a few changed bytes in one spot, there is a high
probability that the two chunk streams will quickly fall back in sync
with each other -- most of the chunks will be identical, and can be
shared. This chunking process is an excellent complement to persistent
data structures.
